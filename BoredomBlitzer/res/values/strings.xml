    <string name="about_main">Welcome to the Boredom Blitzer!  My name is Katherine Westphal and I created this little app to help kids play more, indoors and outdoors. The activities in this app are designed to be fun, first and foremost.  Many activities involve moving around, reducing childhood obesity and improving fitness.  Many activities involve playing with others, building social skills.  Many involve creativity, boosting brain activity.\n\n

        This app was produced by <a href="http://www.zonabidesign.com">zonabidesign</a>.

Note: A few of the activities involve minor risks, like climbing trees.  While there is a small risk of injury, it is up to the parents to teach their children how to manage risks and stay safe.  In purchasing the app, parents assume all liability for their childrenâ€™s safety.</string>
